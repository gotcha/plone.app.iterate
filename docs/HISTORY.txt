Changelog
=========

2.0 (unreleased)
----------------

* Changed IIterateAware superclass from IReferenceable to Interface,
  because plone.app.dexterity should be usable for contents not
  implementing IReferenceable (like all dexterity content types).
  [jbaumann]

* Adjusted test setup for Plone 5.
  [hannosch]

* Added the z3c.autoinclude entry point so this package is automatically loaded
  on Plone 3.3 and above.
  [hannosch]

* Add an alternative IObjectCopier implementation that doesn't touch
  subitems of folders.  That is, a folder is checked out without its
  contents, and on check in, contents from the original object are
  used.
  [nouri]

* Complete the extension profile by adding the rolemap file.
  [hannosch]

* Avoid a test dependency on quick installer.
  [hannosch]

* Use our own PloneMessageFactory. We don't depend on CMFPlone anymore.
  [hannosch]

* Specified package dependencies.
  [hannosch]

* Made the tests independent of default content.
  [hannosch]

1.2.3 - 2008-11-14
------------------

* Fix assumption in control view: not every context object is
  IReferenceable. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8737
  [nouri]

1.2.2 - 2008-11-13
------------------

* Fix action coniditions for the nth time; this time it's an
  over-ambitious "Cancel check-out" permission.  This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8735
  [nouri]

1.2.1 - 2008-11-11
------------------

* Refine permissions fix from 1.2.0 and make tests pass again:

  - Don't require Modify Portal Content (MPC) permission on the
    original to check out, which was omitted in the fix for 1.2.0.

  - Don't require MPC on the original for cancelling of checkout, only
    require it on the working copy.
  [nouri]

* Fix missing internationnalization (#8608 thanks to Vincent Fretin)
  [encolpe]

1.2.0 - 2008-10-24
------------------

* Allow users without modify content permissions (but with the iterate
  check out permission) to check out items, and only allow them to
  check in back again only when they have modify content permissions.
  [nouri]

1.1.5 - 2008-08-18
------------------

* Fixed typo in subscribers/workflow.py. This fixes
  https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8035.
  [dunlapm]

* Added i18n of status messages. This fixes part of 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8022.
  [naro]

1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
------------------

* Fixed dodgy test in test_iterate.py that was dependent on semantics of 
  default workflow.
  [optilude]

* Fixed i18n markup and updated some messages. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7958.
  [hannosch]

* Updated i18n:domain in templates to the plone domain. There's no need for a
  iterate domain.
  [hannosch]

* Use README.txt and HISTORY.txt for the package's long description.
  [wichert]

* Remove unneeded intialize method from __init__
